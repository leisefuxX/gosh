# The webserver section describes the web server's configuration.

# The web server will be bound to some socket (TCP or Unix) and starts listening
# for either HTTP or FastCGI requests.
webserver:
  # listen defines on which protocol ("tcp" or "unix") the listener should be
  # bound to. The value must either be a tuple of an IP address and a port or a
  # file system path for the Unix domain socket. Please make sure that
  # listen_protocol matches.
  listen:
    protocol: "tcp"
    bound: ":8080"

  # unix_socket's chmod, owner, and group are setting the file system
  # permissions for the socket if listen_protocol is "unix".
  unix_socket:
    chmod: "0600"
    owner: "www"
    group: "www"

  # protocol defines the application level protocol the web server should speak.
  # It should be either "http", for an HTTP server, or "fcgi", for FastCGI.

  # item_config sets restrictions for new items, e.g., their max_size, in bytes
  # or suffixed with a unit, and max_lifetime, as a Go duration. Furthermore,
